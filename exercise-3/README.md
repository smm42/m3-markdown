# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

The *cd* Command
-
The *cd* command can be used in both Mac's **Terminal** and Windows' **Command Prompt**.  It changes the directory from whatever it was before the command to what you specify.  For instance, if you are currently in a file path labeled "*/Users/Sean/Documents/Info201/*" and you type in the following into either **Terminal** or **Command Prompt**:

`cd /Users/Sean/Documents/Info201/Assignment1/`

You will then be moved from the "*/Users/Sean/Documents/Info201/*" directory to the "*/Users/Sean/Documents/Info201/Assignment1/*" Directory.  Pretty neat, huh?
